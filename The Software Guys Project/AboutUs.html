 <br>    
<p> The Software Guys was formed with the sole purpose of providing an array of Software options to Students all around the Republic of Ireland. Allowing access for those who who may have financial difficulites or cannot work from home, we draw up negociable and resonable yearly rates for our student customers, allowing them to choose their subscription terms and allow them access to all the software applications on offer. Of course, they can also choose to rent a particular software application of their choosing if they will have unecessary access to additonal resources through bundles for an increased price, simply contact us letting us know and we will draw up a new monthly cost for you. See the "Our Services" Tab for more Information.
